# AWS Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Right-Size Instances**  
   Analyze underutilized EC2 instances with AWS Compute Optimizer and downsize accordingly.

2. **Use Savings Plans or Reserved Instances**  
   Commit to steady workloads for 1 or 3 years to get up to 72% cost reduction.

3. **Leverage Spot Instances**  
   Use EC2 Spot for fault-tolerant workloads like CI/CD or batch jobs.

4. **Automate Start/Stop Schedules**  
   Use Lambda or Instance Scheduler to stop non-production resources after office hours.

5. **Monitor Costs Continuously**  
   Enable AWS Budgets and Cost Anomaly Detection to get alerts for unexpected usage.
